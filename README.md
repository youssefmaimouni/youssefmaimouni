## 🔬 Experience

- **Data Science Intern @ SCInc. (2025)**  
  Developed an **Intelligent Shelf Product Detection and Classification** system integrating:
  - YOLOv8 for shelf detection  
  - Detectron2 (Mask R-CNN) for segmentation  
  - ResNet-50 for classification  
  - ORB + BFMatcher for similarity matching  
  👉 Successfully automated large-scale retail shelf analysis.

- **Web Developer Intern @ Webagency-Maroc (2024)**  
  Built a **stock management system** with:
  - Backend: Laravel (REST APIs)  
  - Frontend: React.js + TailwindCSS  
  - API docs: Swagger  
  👉 Improved efficiency and reduced manual errors.

## 📂 Projects

- **Enhancing Cloud Security with AI (FYP)**  
  Compared models (CNN-LSTM, RF, MLP, BiLSTM, SAE) on UNSW-NB15, NSL-KDD, CICIDS2017; deployed on Azure → faster detection, fewer false positives.  

- **Clustering Arabic Articles (NLP)**  
  Processed **52k+ articles** → hybrid TF-IDF + BERT vectorization, K-Means clustering, similarity analysis, mT5 summarization, and Stable Diffusion illustrations.  

- **Car & House Price Prediction Model**  
  End-to-end ML pipeline (TensorFlow/Keras + Flask API + React frontend) for price prediction with dashboards and interactive analytics.  

- **Exam Attendance Management System**  
  Full-stack web + mobile app with **QR code attendance** (React, React Native, Laravel) used for secure exam monitoring.
